# Vue web-bluetooth arduino-starter

A nice starting point for a PWA that talks to an arduino.
Opens up a way to use a standby phone as a gui for multiple hobby, home and security devices.

Maybe software isn't eating the _whole_ world, but it certainly is gobbling up physical dials and switches!!

Now you can give any arduino project a GUI.

Based heavily off of the vanilla [WebBluetooth-Terminal](https://github.com/hewittwill/WebBluetooth-Terminal), and [Web Bluetooth Samples](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/).

This was the exact hardware module used: [JDY-08 CC2541 BLUETOOTH 4.0 BLE SERIAL MODULE](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/bluetooth/1441-jdy-08-cc2541-bluetooth-40-ble-serial-module.html).

Here's a [video intro and demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jZKu5tQWnM) under 5 minutes long.

## Potential Gotchas

Make sure your browser has web-bluetooth enabled.

Note that web-bluetooth only works with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 devices.

The BLE Serial Module is a simplification of the full BLE approach. There is only one service (0xffe0), and one characteristic (0xffe1). So all messaging consists of changing that one characteristic from either the app or the arduino side.

The exact module I used has a default baud rate of 115200. I will probably drop that down to 9600 for my personal projects, because I think that will carry the messages better over longer distances. Some examples of such commands can be seen in [bluetooth-hardware-utils.ino](bluetooth-hardware-utils/bluetooth-hardware-utils.ino) , but different modules might differ, so refer to the datasheet for specifics.

## To Do

- Better PWA aspects (particularly an update-available alert)
- Demonstration of a more fleshed out GUI using this as a starting point.
